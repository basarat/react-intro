Provide a simple setup steps that can fit in one page.

This is a sample project from the TypeScript book : [*TypeScript Deep Dive*](https://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/content/docs/quick/browser.html).

# Setup

git clone https://github.com/basarat/react-intro.git
npm install
npm run watch
```

Now you can open `index.html` in your browser to see the results. Edit a TypeScript file and refresh your browser to play around.
